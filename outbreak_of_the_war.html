            <p>The outbreak of the First World War was marked by a rapid sequence of events following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Austria-Hungary's demands on Serbia led to increased tensions with Russia, who was committed to defending Serbia. Germany's support of Austria-Hungary and its declaration of war against Russia and France set the stage for a wider European war. Britain's entry into the war, following Germany's invasion of Belgium, solidified the opposing alliances. This section examines these pivotal moments, detailing how diplomatic efforts failed and how quickly nations mobilized for a war that would reshape the world.</p>
