            <p>The First World War was characterized by massive military campaigns and battles across various fronts. In the West, trench warfare led to a deadly stalemate, with battles like the Somme and Verdun inflicting unprecedented casualties. The Eastern Front saw more fluid warfare, with significant engagements such as Tannenberg and the Brusilov Offensive. Technological advancements like tanks, airplanes, and chemical warfare added new dimensions to the conflict. Naval battles, including Jutland, played a key strategic role. This section provides an overview of these key military actions, illustrating the vast scale and complexity of the war.</p>
