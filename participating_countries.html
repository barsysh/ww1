            <p>The First World War saw a vast array of nations drawn into the conflict, primarily divided between the Allies and the Central Powers. The Allies, initially composed of France, Britain, and Russia, were later joined by Italy and the United States among others. On the other side were the Central Powers, led by Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire. The war's global scale was unprecedented, with battles fought across Europe, Asia, Africa, and the high seas. Each nation's military and industrial might were pushed to their limits, with strategies and alliances continually evolving. This section delves into the roles and contributions of these key nations, offering insights into the complex geopolitical landscape of the early 20th century.</p>
